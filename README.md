# Repeat - habit Tracker

Good habits are the key to success but building them might be a challenge. Repeat is a simple habit tracker that helps you to stick with the habits that make you the person you want to become. üöÄüöÄ‚ú®

This project was done as a final project in Codecademy Front-end Engineer Career path. The goal for the project was to build an application to that you are passionate about building. I wanted to learn few additional technologies so I decided to build it with React Native.

## personal experience

Using React Native was new to me and I really kind of fell in love with it. It's a bummer there's no free way to deploy the app as I really feel I would use it. The hardest part of the project was to impliment the AsyncStore and to come up wih the idea how to keep on track and refresh the habits daily/weekly or monthly. 

## Last words

Any feedback or improvement ideas higly appreciated. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
